# BrightnessOverride sample
This is a small sample to show the use of [BrightnessOverride](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.graphics.display.brightnessoverride) API in a HoloLens UWP app.

Currently builds with [Unity 2017.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2017.4).  HoloLense needs to have the Windows 10 Spring 2018 update or later.

The following voice commands should work:
- **Off** – set screen brightness to 0
- **On** – set screen brightness to 1
- **Darker** – reduce the screen brightness by 10%
- **Brighter** – increase the screen brightness by 10%
- **Hide** – hide the cube
- **Show** – show the cube
- **Quit** – quit the app
